# Group Security Hardening Project
Group Project for CIS 221 - Server Security Hardening, Data Flow Diagram, and Server Analysis

**Project: Security Hardening and Intrusion Detection**

Worked in a team of three to implement and demonstrate fundamental system security hardening practices. The project involved:

•	Configuring Intrusion Detection System (IDS) software to monitor and respond to suspicious activity.
•	Disabling unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface.
•	Conducting extensive monitoring of port 22 (SSH) traffic for detection and analysis of potential threats.
•	Performing Nmap scans to assess vulnerabilities and validate system defences.
•	Implementing automatic security updates to maintain best security practices.

This project provided hands-on experience in system hardening, proactive monitoring, and practical network security defence strategies.

Software/Hardware: Linux, VirtualBox and Ubuntu
